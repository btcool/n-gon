To integrate this mod into your own, you need to copy js/mod.js to your mod and add \<script src="js/mod.js"\>\</script\> into index.html.
I do not require that you ask permission, but please do put credit into the _about_ section on the main page if the mod file does not add it automatically.
If you want to have me add your mod into the loader, please note that I will not directly modify any game files, and thus all mods must be injected via JavaScript. You will be given credit in the _about_ page and on README.MD
